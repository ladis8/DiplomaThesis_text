     SunFibre Wearable Active Lighting Technology is an optic fibre lighting system that increases visibility in darkness or lowlight conditions. Unlike retroreflective safety elements, it emits light through optic fibres encased in a textile coating, ensuring active protection. Side-emitting optic fibres provide visibility in all directions up to a distance of 3 kilometres. The properties of the textile coated optic fibre allow easy sewing into textile products and guaranteed mechanical durability and washability. The system is easy to operate and recharge
